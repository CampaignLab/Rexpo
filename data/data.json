So itâ€™s obvious she was shopping around for somewhere to claim to be livingâ€¦\n\nShe lives in Yorkshire, but has thrown money at the problem and rented somewhere to make it go awayâ€¦\n\nThe hearing does not rule out an appeal or a police investigation in to the way sheâ€™s approached this.\n\nIf she wins tomorrow, it will hang over her Mayoralty.",

This came about as the Independent candidate's team had asked North Kesteven whether she was living in Lincolnshire.\nAs the relevant individuals did not attend to provide evidence on behalf of Reform the Officer stated: \"I do not make any determination that the subject was not entitled to be registered.  The only question to be decided by the Electoral Registration Officer is whether the subject was on the 24th February 2025, and is now, resident at the Address given.\"\nI understand that this means that, if Jenkyns is elected, a legal challenge can be launched on grounds of residency.\nFollowing Friday's non-decision Reform Chairman Zia Yusuf tweeted as shown below...resulting in the Community Note shown.\nI think there are two important aspects to this.\n\n1 Local election rules are different.  The residency or connection requirement is there to stop political parties parachuting in preferred candidates from outside the area.  In this respect it feels Reform have broken the spirit of the law if not the letter of the law.\n2 One of the things many people have had enough of is spin and non-fact statements.  The Community Note is saying this was not a Tory attack.  As far as I can tell it has not yet failed.  The Lincolnshire Independents raised a valid question which has not yet been answered.",
