The picture here from the Election Return shows Rob Gibson signed the return as Election Agent and therefore assuming responsibility for the Spending Return. The rules during an election are very clear, the source of every donation must be fully declared or the donation should be returned.

Farage linked entities such as UKIP, the Brexit Campaign and the Brexit Party all tried to use methods to try and by-pass campaign funding rules leading to various actions being taken against them.

He isn't a RICS member, which is a requirement to use the Chartered Surveyor designation. His company isn't on the Regulated by RICS list, because he isn't a member and wouldn't be able to apply.

This came about as the Independent candidate's team had asked North Kesteven whether she was living in Lincolnshire.
As the relevant individuals did not attend to provide evidence on behalf of Reform the Officer stated: ""I do not make any determination that the subject was not entitled to be registered.  The only question to be decided by the Electoral Registration Officer is whether the subject was on the 24th February 2025, and is now, resident at the Address given.""
I understand that this means that, if Jenkyns is elected, a legal challenge can be launched on grounds of residency.
Following Friday's non-decision Reform Chairman Zia Yusuf tweeted as shown below...resulting in the Community Note shown.
I think there are two important aspects to this.

1 Local election rules are different.  The residency or connection requirement is there to stop political parties parachuting in preferred candidates from outside the area.  In this respect it feels Reform have broken the spirit of the law if not the letter of the law.
2 One of the things many people have had enough of is spin and non-fact statements.  The Community Note is saying this was not a Tory attack.  As far as I can tell it has not yet failed.  The Lincolnshire Independents raised a valid question which has not yet been answered."
